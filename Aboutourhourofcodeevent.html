    <h1 id="hourofcode">Hour of Code</h1>
<p id="hourofcode">During Computer Science Education Week from December 9 to December 15, 2013, Code.org launched the "Hour of Code Challenge" on its website to teach computer science to school students, enticing them to complete short programming tutorials. The Hour of Code involved getting people to write short snippets of code to achieve pre-specified goals using Blockly, a visual programming language of a similar flavor as Logo.</p>

<h2 id="hourofcode">Our Hour of Code event:</h2>


<div id="Our arriving to school">
<h3 id="left">Our arriving to school</h3>
<p id="left">On November 15th at 7:30 we arrived in Baku Secondary School No.167 which is located in Yasamal district. The reason for going earlier than the start time, was to check all the hardware and software, if projector works properly, if speakers work, we connected to the Internet, one last time checked presentation slides and Code.org website, and had enough time to practice our speech. Additionally, our early arrival gave us the chance to get the list of students’ names and print colorful diplomas for every one of them. We signed their names on certificates and were ready to hand them to our future winners. At first, we had a problem related to not having enough computers for every student, since we had joined two classes of students in order to be able to inform more and more pupils. We talked to the director of the school to help us solve that problem, and she was more than happy to help us. She provided us with laptops from the informatics room and our first issue was resolved. Every one of us was nervous at the beginning, we were a little bit anxious about catching the students’ attention and having everything under control, but since we were well-prepared, we were able to manage all the problems that occurred on our way. At 8 o’clock sharp we started the hour of code together with 34 9th-grade students.</p>

<div id="Starting our presentation">
<h3 id="right">Starting our presentation</h3>
<p id="right">We started our work by introducing ourselves. Initially, we struggled with catching their attention, but then we could attract them to our presentation and question their interests. We asked the students if they were interested in IT or Computer Sciences and Engineering and which University, they had in their mind to apply for. We found out that there were 3 students who were particularly interested in the IT field. Moreover, we answered their questions about how many points they needed to apply for particular majors, and if it is possible to go to ADA University without having to study foundation. We explained to them that in order to start their education without spending an extra year they needed IELTS, TOEFL, or Duolingo certificates with required points. Approximately for 20 minutes we talked about ADA University based on the presentation provided, introduced schools, faculties, administration, payment, discount, and finally about the students that successfully finished and got ADA University degree and continue their career successfully as well. We were glad that our speech was useful and gave them a broad idea about ADA University. </p>

<div id="About code.org">
<h3 id="left">About code.org</h3>
<p id="left"> Having presented our slides about ADA University, we proceeded with introducing the Code.org website for approximately 10 minutes. When we first asked the class if anyone had ever heard about it, we found out that few children knew about it. Firstly, we introduced the aim of Code.org. We mainly used the information given in “about us” part of the Code.org and presented them with the PPT file that we created. Founder, famous supporting companies, international supporting organizations, features that are suggested, and last but not least main purposes of the website were the topics that we covered. We talked about Hour of Code, how widely it is spread and how effective it is, as well. For the last part of the introduction, students watched a video about Code.org that is shared by Code.org itself with Azerbaijani subtitles. Furthermore, during the introduction part we did not face any problems, everything went well. Initially we were skeptical about children's participation, however, they proved us wrong by showing a great interest and being active in asking questions. Some teachers even joined us and listened to this event. We assume that the topics we talked about during our presentation were interesting for the participants, including teachers.  </p>

<h3 id="right">Hour of Code</h3>
<p id="right"> As we finished the introduction part, we began Hour of code. Additional to the instruction video, we explained what to do and how to solve questions given on website once again for not keeping any unclear parts students’ mi’ minds. We started this event; we divided students into 5 teams (in order to create competitiveness among children) and gave a floor to them. They started to work, and surely, they were allowed to ask for help from us. While helping them with problems that they were not able to solve, we tried to treat them more like friends rather than instructors so that they would not hesitate to ask for our help. All of these encouraging steps had positively influenced the atmosphere that we created, and all the students successfully completed the course with only a few hints from us. On top of all, they accomplished the course in less time than we estimated. Afterwards, we awarded the students with the diplomas showing their accomplishment of the course and we presented a book about Informatics and Coding to the top 3 students who completed all the problems before others. After having successfully finished the Hour of Code event, we were interested in figuring out what kind of impression this event left on them. We were glad to receive positive responses and have more and more students been engaged in this event.  </p>

<div id="Conclusion of event">
<h3 id="left">Conclusion of event</h3>
<p id="left">This event was not only helpful for more and more students from our country to receive information about the Code.org website, but it also acted as a useful tool for dragging our young generation’s interest to fields such as IT, Computer Sciences, and Computer Engineering. We, ourselves, enjoyed participating in this event, in which we had a chance to communicate with children and learn about their dreams related to their future careers. We were happy to know that some students were positively influenced by our speech and are planning to pick ADA University and SITE (School of IT and Engineering) fields for their future careers. We genuinely believe that they will be able to achieve those goals and are looking forward to meeting them in our university. In future, we would like to take part in more events like this, where we can be useful to inform and get at least one student’s attention to SITE majors. </p>
